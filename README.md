# signupform

A front-end browser project that utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript to simulate a sign up form.

This project simulates the front-end of a sign up form using HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling,
and Javascript for validating password input. It utilizes HTML forms as the core of the webpage, using
patterns as basic input validation. CSS is used to make the webpage look appealing, using basic selectors, 
flexboxes, and pseudo classes for the best display. Javascript is used to simulate input validation of
passwords, making sure they match and adding classes to style the input fields based on validity.
(This webpage is for simulating the front-end, so there is no actual password encryption)
